    "I'll be using a *top-down* teaching method, which is different from how most math courses operate.  Typically, in a *bottom-up* approach, you first learn all the separate components you will be using, and then you gradually build them up into more complex structures.  The problems with this are that students often lose motivation, don't have a sense of the \"big picture\", and don't know what they'll need.\n",

That is, you can start driving without [knowing how an internal combustion engine works](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/thoughts-after-taking-the-deeplearning-ai-courses-8568f132153), and children begin playing baseball before they learn all the formal rules."
